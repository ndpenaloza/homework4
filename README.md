# homework4 - Web APIs: Code Quiz

Description:

This project involves creating a quiz that manipulates the DOM. Once the quiz began, a timer started to tick down. With every correct point, the user's score would increment by 1 point, and with every incorrect choice resulted in a decrement of 5 seconds off the timer. Every choice also resulted in a new question and set of options populating the DOM.
